Your task is to use json placeholder to create a dummy social network page with designated url's using react router dom.

Using the /users and /posts endpoints, show a list of posts on the main page. 
 the flow should be as follows:
V. in the main page, fetch the list of posts.
V. render the list of posts (each post can be some kind of card component), where each post component is responsible of fetching and storing the user information.
X. each post should show the name of the user whos e post it belongs to, next to some kind of generic user icon. beneath should be the title of the post and underneath the body.
V the feed should have the url path of "/app/feed"
V the feed page should use class components logic 
- on clicking on a user name/icon the user should be redirected to a "user page", where the name, email, username and address is being shown.
- this user page should have the path url of "/app/user/<userId>"
- the user page should use functional/ compnents/hooks logic

*optional (and hard!): use the /comments endpoints, so that when the user clicks on a post, it expands and shows all comments below (with commenter name and comment)

*please note - there's a newer version (v6) for react router dom, you should use v5 though!

A parody about Facebook dummy social network page with designated url's using react router dom.

Q:"Using the /users and /posts endpoints" what doesthat means? A: Endpoint refers to an "API Endpoint", so an address, that when making a call to (using fetch/axios or any ither method) will return a status and some form of content

Q:"component is responsible of fetching and storing the user information" A: You can choose how to manage the data in your components - although propa seems to be the right approach with the posts to me

class component + => main page? /comments => in which page?

*react router dom v5!
