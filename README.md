DumbBook
A parody about Facebook dummy social network page with designated url's using react router dom.

Q:"Using the /users and /posts endpoints" what doesthat means? A: Endpoint refers to an "API Endpoint", so an address, that when making a call to (using fetch/axios or any ither method) will return a status and some form of content

Q:"component is responsible of fetching and storing the user information" A: You can choose how to manage the data in your components - although propa seems to be the right approach with the posts to me

class component + => main page? /comments => in which page?

*react router dom v5!

//non main =(loggin)> MAIN //MAIN => url:"/app/feed" fetch list lists of posts //CARD-Post name+icon title body => url:"/post/" //User-Page= i) "/app/user/" ii)fuctional component iii)name, email, username and address
